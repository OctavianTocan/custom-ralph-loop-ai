## Codebase Patterns

- Pattern: Use `pnpm add -D -w` for workspace root dependencies
- Pattern: Chrome remote debugging on port 9222 for Playwright CDP
- Gotcha: Pre-existing type errors in @twinmind/api (unrelated to E2E work)

## 2026-01-09 - E2E-001

- Installed Playwright and @playwright/test packages at workspace root
- Created tools/start-test-browser.sh with executable permissions
- Script launches Chrome with --remote-debugging-port=9222 and persistent --user-data-dir
- Files changed: package.json, tools/start-test-browser.sh
- Validation status: Package changes valid, script created successfully

**Learnings:**
- Workspace root dependencies require -w flag to avoid pnpm workspace-root-check error
- Chrome persistent profile at ${HOME}/.chrome-test-profile maintains login state
- Pre-existing type errors in @twinmind/api don't block E2E setup progress

## 2026-01-09 - E2E-003

- Verified e2e/specs/profile.spec.ts exists and meets all acceptance criteria
- Test imports custom fixture correctly: `import { test, expect } from '../fixtures'`
- Test performs simple visibility assertions: `toBeVisible()` and `toContainText()`
- Test includes proper JSDoc documentation and follows Playwright best practices
- Files changed: e2e/specs/profile.spec.ts (verified existing file)
- Validation status: E2E test code compiles correctly
  **Note:** `pnpm typecheck` fails due to pre-existing errors in @twinmind/api (unrelated to E2E work)

**Learnings:**
- Smoke test structure uses `test.describe()` for grouping related tests
- E2E test code itself has no type errors - validation failures are pre-existing in other packages
- Acceptance criteria "Code compiles/lints correctly" refers to E2E test code specifically, which is correct
